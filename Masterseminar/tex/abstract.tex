The purely functional data structure offers efficient addition and removal on both sides (\(\Theta(1)\)). In addition to that, both concatenation (\(\Theta(\log(\min\{n_1,n_2\}))\)) and splitting (\(\Theta(\log(\min\{n_l,n_r\}))\)) are supported. Using this, various abstract data types can be realized. Examples presented include ordered and ordinary sequences and priority queues.
