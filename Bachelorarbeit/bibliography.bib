abstract="Isabelle [28, 30] is an interactive theorem prover that supports a variety of logics. It represents rules as propositions (not as functions) and builds proofs by combining rules. These operations constitute a meta-logic (or `logical framework') in which the object-logics are formalized. Isabelle is now based on higher-order logic-a precise and well-understood foundation.",
