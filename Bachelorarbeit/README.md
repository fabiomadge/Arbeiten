We give a primer on *Isabelle's* most heavily used mechanism to create new theorems in kernel, rule composition. Building on that understanding we discuss options for a alternative implementation. This happens with the explicit goal of shrinking the trusted code base by expressing it as a derived rule. To achieve this, existing kernel primitives are used and the results of previously trusted code are verified. We share the knowledge generated by implementing a first prototype, along with some benchmarks.
