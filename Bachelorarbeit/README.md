This thesis describes the most heavily used proof mechanism offered by *Isabelle* kernel, rule composition, operates. Building on that understading an alternative implementation of it is discussed. The goal was to shrink the trusted codebase by reusing existing kernel primitives and verifing the output of previously trusted code, while maintaining the current performance.

The advisor was Simon Wimmer of the Chair for Logic and Verification at TUM.
