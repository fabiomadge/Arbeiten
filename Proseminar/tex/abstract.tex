The solution to the Stable Marriage Problem presented by the Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm \cite{Gale:1962} is not only applicable for the strict version of the problem, but also some generalizations. Some of these extensions are justified and proofed. Furthermore asymptotic optimality of the algorithm is discussed.
