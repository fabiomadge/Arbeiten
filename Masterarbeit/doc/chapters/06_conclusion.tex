\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

We've developed a mostly complete formalization of the Isabelle/Pure logic and motivated many of the features that make it unique among its peers.
To get fullfledged type and term instantiations at arbitrary points in the proof, we added type instantiation to \ax.
There are various directions to take this work further.
Simon Ro√ükopf uses the result of this collaboration to formalize a checker for proof terms, certificates generated by Isabelle.
Formalizing the semantics of the logic could strengthen the confidence in our definitions.
At the moment, we only support operations on a fixed theory.
That is not compatible with the usual workflow of intermixing definitions and other axioms with proofs.
Ultimately formalizing a drop-in replacement of the current kernel would justify a higher degree of trust in the Isabelle system.
