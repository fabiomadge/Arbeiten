# Master's Thesis
Thesis describing my work on formalizing the logic that is implemented by Isabelle/Pure. The goal was to use a minimal axiomatization.

## Proofs
The source files of the formalization are in another [repo](https://bitbucket.org/fabiomadge/verifiedkernel/src/refined_predicate/).

## Template
Derived from the trusted unofficial [Template](https://github.com/fwalch/tum-thesis-latex).
